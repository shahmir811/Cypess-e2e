# Cypress E2E

> Leaning how to use [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end to end testing

## Usage

Install npm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

For starting cypress, execute:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

It will open a browser where you can run your tests.

For executing e2e tests without browser, execute:

```bash
npx cypress run --headless

Running e2e tests without browser are helpful for CI/CD pipeline
